    In this exchange, A's discourse is definition-aware, while B's is definition-unaware, and the difference lies in how each person uses or neglects precise definitions.<p>

A begins by expressing a wish: <span class="wow">I wish we lived in a communist regime.</span><p>

Here, A is speaking strictly according to the provided definition of communism: <span class="wow">Communism is every citizen having equal access to the economic resources of a given political entity.</span><p>

A’s statement is therefore conceptually clear and logically consistent. A is not referring to any specific historical regime but rather to the system described by the definition.<p>

By doing so, A demonstrates definition-aware discourse &mdash; that is, discourse where words are used precisely and meanings are kept consistent with their established definitions.<p>

B, on the other hand, replies: <span class="wow">Are you serious, man? Every Soviet regime was a tyranny.</span><p>

Here, B assumes that the term communism refers to the Soviet regimes of the 20th century. However, these regimes were only called communist in name.<p>

In reality, they were <span class="ul">pseudo-communist</span>, since only a small elite &mdash; roughly 10% of the population &mdash; had any meaningful access to the economic resources of the country.<p>

The vast majority of citizens were excluded from such access, which directly violates the definition of communism.<p>

By equating communism with these pseudo-communist systems, B commits a category error, attacking something different from what A actually expressed.<p>

This makes B’s discourse definition-unaware, as it ignores the precise definition and instead relies on historical labels and stereotypes.<p>

In conclusion, A’s wish reflects a purely defined ideal of communism: a society of true economic equality.<p>

B’s criticism, while emotionally charged, misses the mark because it targets regimes that only falsely bore the label of communism.<p>

This misalignment shows why definition-aware discourse is crucial: without strict adherence to definitions, conversations devolve into confusion, where words are used loosely, and truth is lost.
