    <center><h1>The dynamics</h1></center>
    Neither communism nor democracy has ever taken root anywhere in the world, and contrary to public sentiment, the two converge, as we shall see in this series of illustrated examples on horistics.<p>

It is true that Sovietism, Leninism, and Stalinism proved to be tyrannies beyond doubt — the very thuggish aspect of humanity. These were all regimes led by lowlifes, just like Hitler, Pinochet, Henry Kissinger, and countless others.<p>

But none of that was communism.<p>

For obvious reasons, the West has engaged in extensive propaganda to discredit the word <span class=""wow>communism</span>, while the East has gone to great pains to paint <span class="ul">tyranny</span> as <span class="ur">communism</span>.<p>

This is not political indoctrination, but political education &mdash; an education the whole world has always been in great need for.<p>

In this exchange, A's discourse is definition-aware, while B's is definition-unaware, and the difference lies in how each person uses or neglects precise definitions.<p>

A begins by expressing a wish: <span class="wow">I wish we lived in a communist regime.</span><p>

Here, A is speaking strictly according to the provided definition of communism: <span class="wow">Communism is every citizen having equal access to the economic resources of a given political entity.</span><p>

Communism is a noble, civilized concept, and no one could successfully argue against communism, because there is no excuse why any one at all should have more access to economic resources than anybody else.<hr>

A’s statement is therefore conceptually clear and logically consistent. A is not referring to any specific historical regime but rather to the system described by the definition.<p>

By doing so, A demonstrates definition-aware discourse &mdash; that is, discourse where words are used precisely and meanings are kept consistent with their established definitions.<p>

B, on the other hand, replies: <span class="wow">Are you serious, man? Every Soviet regime was a tyranny.</span><p>

Here, B assumes that the term communism refers to the Soviet regimes of the 20th century. However, these regimes were only called communist in name.<p>

In reality, they were <span class="ul">pseudo-communist</span>, since only a small elite &mdash; roughly 10% of the population &mdash; had any meaningful access to the economic resources of the country.<p>

The vast majority of citizens were excluded from such access, which directly violates the definition of communism.<p>

By equating communism with these pseudo-communist systems, B commits a category error, attacking something different from what A actually expressed.<p>

This makes B’s discourse <span class="ur">definition-unaware</span>, as it ignores the precise definition and instead relies on historical labels and stereotypes.<p>

In conclusion, A’s wish reflects a purely defined ideal of communism: a society of true economic equality.<p>

B’s criticism, while emotionally charged, misses the mark because it targets regimes that only falsely bore the label of communism.<p>

This misalignment shows why <span class="ul">definition-aware</span> discourse is crucial: without strict adherence to definitions, conversations devolve into confusion, where words are used loosely, and truth is lost.
