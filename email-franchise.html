Exploring a Collaboration Between Alpha School & Horistics


Dear School Management Team,

I hope this message finds you well. My name is Isidoros Parlamas, and I am a Socratic scholar and the founder of Horistics, a methodology designed to teach individuals — and increasingly, AI systems — how to define and think, not just what to think.

Your pioneering work resonates deeply with my vision. While your model redefines how time is used in education, Horistics focuses on how the mind engages with knowledge itself. Our framework has potential applications in:

Deep critical thinking development for students,

Enhancing Socratic discussions with structured reasoning,

Providing AI-driven learning platforms with a foundation for truly intelligent adaptation.

I believe there is a unique opportunity to combine our approaches to create an environment where students not only learn efficiently but also develop lasting cognitive agility that prepares them for an unpredictable future.

Would you be open to a brief conversation to explore how Horistics might support and expand your mission at Bright School?

Thank you for your time and for the incredible work you are doing to reimagine education. I look forward to the possibility of collaborating.

Warm regards,
Isidoros Parlamas

Subject: Introducing Horistics: A Socratic Methodology for Precise Definition — Ready to Power AI Platforms Today



Dear [School Management Team / School Administration],

My name is Isidoros Parlamas, and I have spent many years as a Socratic scholar, dedicated to the art of questioning and discovery.

Over this time, I have developed Horistics — an innovative framework for formulating airtight definitions and cultivating a deep, precise way of thinking.

I am excited to introduce two one-semester courses I have designed:

One for younger students, built around playful yet profound exercises that help children explore concepts and sharpen their reasoning skills.

Another for students aged 15 and older, offering a more rigorous exploration of defining ideas and dismantling ambiguity — skills essential for advanced learning and leadership.

These courses are structured to operate much like a franchise, providing schools and colleges with comprehensive teaching materials, training, and ongoing support.
This makes it easy to integrate Horistics into your curriculum while giving your institution a distinctive, marketable edge.

What makes Horistics especially timely is that it is designed to integrate seamlessly with Artificial Intelligence (AI).
As AI becomes a dominant force in education and society, students must learn how to think with clarity and precision so they can guide and work alongside these technologies.
Horistics provides the intellectual foundation for training both humans and machines to understand and apply unambiguous definitions, which is vital for future innovation and ethical development.

Horistics is more than a subject — it is a discipline of clarity.
In a world where vague or imprecise thinking can lead to confusion, Horistics trains students to approach every idea, argument, and problem with rigor, precision, and confidence.

I would be delighted to discuss how these courses could benefit your school and help you equip your students with this transformative skill set. Please let me know a convenient time for a call or meeting.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to the possibility of working together to bring this unique educational offering to your community.
